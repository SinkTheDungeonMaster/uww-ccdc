        Within OpenShift, the Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) stack
        aggregates logs from nodes and applications running inside your OpenShift
        Enterprise installation. Once deployed it uses Fluentd to aggregate logs
        from all nodes, projects, and pods into Elasticsearch. OpenShift also
        provides a centralized Kibana web UI where users and administrators can
        create rich visualizations and dashboards with aggregated data.

        To properly plan for audit log retention, refer to "Storage Considerations"
        of the OpenShift installation and configuration guide. Production
        installations often generate in excess of 50GB/day of audit information.
