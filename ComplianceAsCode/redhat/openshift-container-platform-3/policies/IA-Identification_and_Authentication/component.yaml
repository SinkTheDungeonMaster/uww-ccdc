        authentication for network access to privileged accounts.

        A successful control response will need to address all network-
        accessible privileged account types and the means by which
        multifactor authentication is enforced for each.

        OpenShift provides a plugable authentication architecture that can
        utilize 3rd party authentication schemes that include multi-factor
        authentication. The authentication subsystem in OpenShift relies on
        OAuth 2.0 and any system that can interact with the OAuth token service
        over HTTPS can recieve authentication tokens. Typically this is
        implemented using OpenShift-provided RequestHeaderIdentityProvider as
        described in Section 12.3.8, Request Header, of the OpenShift v3.3
        Installation and Configuration Guide:

        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/install_config/
        configuring_authentication.html#RequestHeaderIdentityProvider
        
        Many customers are accepting password-enabled SSH keys as multi-
        factor authentication. The SSH key (something they have) and the
        decryption password (something they know). Prior to enabling CAC
        and PIV cards, it is recommended to seek guidance from the
        Information Security Officer responsible for authorization of
        OpenShift.'
