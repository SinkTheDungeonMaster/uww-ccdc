        With the exception of access established through physical presense 
        at the hardware and underlying operating system layers, connections to
        OpenShift are treated as remote connections. Authorization and
        authentication controls selected and verified from the IA family apply
        to this control; no independant control response is required.'

        'The customer will be responsible for terminating the session and
        network connections when non-local maintenance and diagnostic activities
        are completed. A successful control response will need to address
        monitoring and enforcement of the disconnection requirement.

        This is frequently accomplished by automatic logon timeouts from the
        OpenShift web console, and SSH connection timeouts provided by the
        underlying operating system.'
