        To assist Systems Administrators and Security personnel in answering
        this control in relation to OpenShift, Red Hat does not provide
        disaster recovery subscriptions for OpenShift. However, there are a
        couple of ways that a cluster can be configured to failover in the case
        of emergency or catastrophic failure. One way is to configure the
        cluster with geographically diverse set of nodes in different
        availability zones. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/machine_management/creating-infrastructure-machinesets.html for creating
        MachineSets for nodes to operate in different clouds.

        Alternatively, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes
        is a solution for multi-cluster deployment and management across
        different many differing operating environments. Red Hat Advanced
        Cluster Management for Kubernetes is considered a better tool to
        manage Kubernetes Clusters and to handle cluster failover in case of
        failure. Documentation can be viewed at:
