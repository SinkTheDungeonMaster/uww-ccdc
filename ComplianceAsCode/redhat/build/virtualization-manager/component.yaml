        Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

        A control response is planned. Engineering
        progress can be tracked via:

        Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) does not have the capability to automatically

        external emergency or temporary accounts will be
        inherited from, and managed by, an external
        identity service (e.g. Active Directory, LDAP, etc.)

# AC-2(3) NOTES:

#       AC-2(3) differs by disabling *every other* account type

        Changes to Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) information flows take effect immediately. It is assumed
        that all information flow modifications have undergone organizational
        approval processes prior to being implemented in Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM).

        Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) cannot protect against authenticated users who were
        given authorization to execute administrative commands (such as
        information flow modifications).

        Privileged Administrators are defined as authenticated users who
        were given authorization to execute privileged commands on Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM)
        systems (e.g. "sudo access").

        To modify security policies users must first authenticate with
        standard credentials (e.g. username/password or username/key).
        Once authenticated users must elevate privileges to root access
        through usage of "sudo", which will require users to re-authenticate
        themselves.

        Privileged Administrators are defined as authenticated users who
        were given authorization to execute privileged commands on Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM)
        systems (e.g. "sudo access").

        The default system behavior allows Privileged Administrators
        to (re)configure security policy filters. For example,
        to reflect changes in network security policies, Privileged
        Administrators can dynamically change the allowed network
        ports and protocols that security policy mechanisms (such
        as firewalld) check in accordance with the definitions
        provided by organizations.

        Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) utilizes the firewall technology named firewalld
        that allows a system administrator to configure host-based rules which take effect
        immediately. This gives an Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) operator the ability
        to immediately drop all remote connections.

        A control response is planned. Engineering

        The selection of organization-defined auditable events is not applicable

        However, as supplementary information, RHVH was designed to audit events

        suggested to be audited:

              * Permission Modifications (Success/Failure)
              * Ownership Modifications (Success/Failure)
            - User & Group Management Events
              * User add, delete, modify, suspend, lock (Success/Failure)
              * Group/Role add, delete, modify (Success/Failure)
            - Use of Privileged/Special Rights Events
              * Security or audit policy changes (Success/Failure)
              * Configuration Changes (Success/Failure)
            - Admin or root-level access (Success/Failure)
            - Privilege/Role escalation (Success/Failure)
            - Audit and log data access (Success/Failure)

        Establishment of organizational system interconnection
        agreements is outside the scope of Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) configuration
        guidance.

        Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) requires a number of ports to be
        opened to allow network traffic through the system firewall. The firewall
        rules are automatically configured by default when adding a new host to
        the Manager, overwriting any pre-existing firewall configuration.

        Documentation on RHVM interconnections is available in the
        Red Hat Virtualization Installation Guide available at:

        Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) is not capable of dynamically managing

## Developers note on SA-4 (2):
##  This control differs from SA-4 (1) in that implementation
##  details are now required.
##
##  The majority of FedRAMP and FISMA Moderate systems refine this control
##  with the following:
##    - Provide design and implementation regarding security-relevant
##      external system interfaces and high-level design;
##    - Provide design and implementation information required by the
##      SDL process;
##    - Above should be provided with a level of detail sufficient for
##      secure deployment.
