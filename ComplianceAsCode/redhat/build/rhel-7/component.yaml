## Note to content authors:
##  IR-2 (1) relates to creating simulated events/scenarios
##  relating to incident response. While this is an organizational
##  control, consider creating component-specific incident
##  response simulations as appropriate (e.g. if a virtualization
##  product, what happens after a VM escape?).
