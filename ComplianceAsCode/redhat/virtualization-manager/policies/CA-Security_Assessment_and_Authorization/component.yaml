        Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) requires a number of ports to be
        opened to allow network traffic through the system firewall. The firewall
        rules are automatically configured by default when adding a new host to
        the Manager, overwriting any pre-existing firewall configuration.

        Documentation on RHVM interconnections is available in the
        Red Hat Virtualization Installation Guide available at:
