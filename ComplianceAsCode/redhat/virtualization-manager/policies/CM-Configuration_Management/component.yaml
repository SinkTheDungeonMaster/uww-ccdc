        It is highly uncommon to deploy additional software on Red Hat
        Virtualization Manager (RHVM) nodes. The following are suggested
        policies to govern the installation of software by users:

        - All software packages must be cryptographically signed
        by a third party the organization trusts (such as
        Red Hat GPG keys);

        - All software repositories configured on the system
        must enforce GPG key verification prior to software
        installation;

        - Previous versions of software should be removed after newer
        versions have been installed.

        The following configuration checks enforce the policies identified
        in CM-11(a):

        - CCE-26957-1: Ensure Red Hat GPG Key Installed

        - CCE-26876-3: Ensure gpgcheck Enabled for All YUM Package Repositories

        - CCE-26989-4: Ensure gpgcheck Enabled In Main YUM Configuration

        - CCE-80347-8: Ensure gpgcheck Enabled for Local Packages

        - CCE-80346-0: Ensure YUM Removes Previous Package Versions

        By default, Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) nodes only allow software
        installation with privileged access through the usage of sudo or the root user.
