        Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

        A control response is planned. Engineering
        progress can be tracked via:

        approval processes prior to being implemented in Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM).

        Privileged Administrators are defined as authenticated users who

        systems (e.g. "sudo access").

        To modify security policies users must first authenticate with

        Once authenticated users must elevate privileges to root access
        through usage of "sudo", which will require users to re-authenticate

        The default system behavior allows Privileged Administrators

        to reflect changes in network security policies, Privileged
        Administrators can dynamically change the allowed network
        ports and protocols that security policy mechanisms (such
        as firewalld) check in accordance with the definitions
        provided by organizations.

        The customer will be responsible for requiring users to use the
        lowest level of access required to perform any given function. In

        Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) utilizes the firewall technology named firewalld
        that allows a system administrator to configure host-based rules which take effect
        immediately. This gives an Red Hat Virtualization Manager (RHVM) operator the ability
        to immediately drop all remote connections.

        A control response is planned. Engineering
        progress can be tracked via:
