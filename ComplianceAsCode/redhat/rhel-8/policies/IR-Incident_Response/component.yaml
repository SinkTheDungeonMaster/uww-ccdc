## Note to content authors:
##  IR-2 (1) relates to creating simulated events/scenarios
##  relating to incident response. While this is an organizational
##  control, consider creating component-specific incident
##  response simulations as appropriate (e.g. if a virtualization
##  product, what happens after a VM escape?).

## Note to content authors:
##  IR-4 (2) is *technically* an organizational control, however
##  many accreditors/auditors will want to understand how the
##  system component integrates with dynamic reconfiguration capabilities.
##  Lacking formal guidance from the government, some auditors expect a
##  response to this control at the component level.
