# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implementation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).

        Configuration management is enforced through Ignition configurations
        and Operators.

        Ignition is the utility that is used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)
        to manipulate disks during initial configuration, confirming all new machines
        meet the declared configuration.

        Ignition is meant to initialize systems, not change existing systems. After
        a machine initializes and the kernel is running from the installed system, the
        Machine Config Operator from the OpenShift Container Platform cluster completes
        all future machine configuration.

        Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes
        application. Watching over the CoreOS environment, using its current
        state to make decisions in real time, the Machine Config Operator (MCO)
        manages updates and configuration changes to essentially everything between
        the kernel and kubelet.

        The organization retaining an organization-defined number of previous versions of baseline

        outside the scope of CoreOS configuration.

        However to assist in formulating a control response, the Machine Config Operator from
        the OpenShift Container Platform cluster completes all future machine configuration. It
        is recommended to store MachineConfigs in a git repository and follow GitOps practices.

        GitOps uses Git pull requests to manage infrastructure and application configurations.
        The Git repository is considered the only source of truth and contains the
        entire state of the system so that the trail of changes to the system state are
        visible and auditable. For more on using Git and GitOps see:

        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/architecture/cicd_gitops.html

        Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) is the preferred way of implementing
        and managing GitOps for OpenShift clusters. For more information on creating and managing
        channels for GitOps approaches using RHACM, see:

        Ensuring that the organization uses software and associated

        Tracking the use of software and associated documentation protected by
        quantity licenses to control copying and distribution is an
        organizational control outside the scope of CoreOS.

        For CoreOS nodes operating in an OpenShift environment, the OpenShift
        Cluster Manager (OCM) service acts as a bridge to Red Hat Subscription Manager.
        A cluster connected to the internet can send telemetry to OpenShift Cluster
        Manager at https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/, which then handles
        integration with Red Hat Subscription Manager to track subscriptions
        for OpenShift clusters.

        For disconnected clusters utilizing CoreOS, there is no way to send telemetry data to
        OpenShift Cluster Manager. In this case, the organization must manually
        register their disconnected clusters with OpenShift Cluster Manager
        following the instructions at https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4930131
