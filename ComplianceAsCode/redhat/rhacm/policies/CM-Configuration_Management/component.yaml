# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implementation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).

        The recommended approach for configuration management for Red Hat Advanced Cluster
        Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) is to implement the principles and patterns of GitOps

        GitOps uses Git pull requests to manage infrastructure and application configurations.
        The Git repository is considered the only source of truth and contains the
        entire state of the system so that the trail of changes to the system state are
        visible and auditable.

        Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) contains capabilities and
        functionality to manage GitOps for OpenShift clusters and applications including
        Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes. For more information on creating and
        managing channels for GitOps approaches using RHACM, see:
