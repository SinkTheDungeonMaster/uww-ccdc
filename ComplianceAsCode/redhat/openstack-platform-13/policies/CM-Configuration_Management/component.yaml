# ADMINISTRATORS NOTE ON CM-2:
#       Implementation of this control varies greatly between customers. Some
#       want centralized config management, while others expect component
#       administrators to handle this (e.g. maintain custom Ansible scripts).
#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).
#
#       In case the customer desires components (e.g. Red Hat OpenStack Platform Admins) to
#       handle configuration management the lines below can be uncommented:
