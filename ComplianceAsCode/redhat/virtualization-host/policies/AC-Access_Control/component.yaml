        Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) components of the system support automated
        management through monitoring of accounts and system
        activity by logging of related information.

        While Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) can generate audit data, and securely
        transport the data to a SIEM, Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) does not provide
        automated mechanisms (e.g. email, text messages) after
        system events. This functionality would fall to third
        party software such as an Identity Provider (IdP),
        Active Directory (MSAD), LDAP, etc.

        Privileged Administrators are defined as authenticated users who
        were given authorization to execute privileged commands on Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH)
        systems (e.g. "sudo access").

        To modify security policies users must first authenticate with
        standard credentials (e.g. username/password or username/key).
        Once authenticated users must elevate privileges to root access
        through usage of "sudo", which will require users to re-authenticate
        themselves.

        The default system behavior allows Privileged Administrators

        to reflect changes in network security policies, Privileged
        Administrators can dynamically change the allowed network
        ports and protocols that security policy mechanisms (such
        as firewalld) check in accordance with the definitions
        provided by organizations.
