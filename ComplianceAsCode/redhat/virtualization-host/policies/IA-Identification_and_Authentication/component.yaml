        The Federal Information Security Management
        Act (FISMA) requires the use of FIPS 140 evaluated cryptography.
        Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) carries several FIPS validations,
        however it is imperitive the system have FIPS enabled.

        To ensure the version of Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) deployed
        carries FIPS validations, the following configuration check must
        be enabled:

        - CCE-80657-0: The Installed Operating System is FIPS 140-2 Certified

        - CCE-80658-8: Set kernel parameter crypto.fips_enabled to 1

        - CCE-80359-3: Enable FIPS Mode in GRUB2

        All information system users, regardless of organizational

        non-configurable default behavior. Any attempts to alter
        user identifiers is audited through events defined in AU-2.
