        The Ansible Tower capacity system determines how many jobs can run on an instance
        given the amount of resources available to the instance and the size of the jobs that
        are running.

        The "Ansible Tower Capacity Determination and Job Impact" section of the
        Ansible Tower User's Guide outlines resource determination factors relevant
        to capacity planning. That document can be found online at:

        Ansible Tower installations can occur in a High Availability (HA) configuration.
        In this configuration, Tower runs with a single active node, called the Primary
        Instance, and any number of inactive nodes, called Secondary Instances.

        Secondary Instances can become Primary Instances at any time, with certain
        caveats. Running in a high-availability setup requires any database that
        Ansible Tower uses to be external -- Postgres and MongoDB must be installed
        on a machine that is not one of the primary or secondary Ansible Tower nodes.

        Ansible Tower's HA mode offers a standby Ansible Tower infrastructure that
        can become active in case of infrastructure failure -- avoiding single points of
        failure. HA mode is not meant to run in an active/passive or multi-master mode, and
        is not a mechanism for horizontally scaling the Ansible Tower service. Further,
        failover to a secondary instance is not automatic and must be user triggered.

        For instructions on how to install Ansible Tower into an HA configuration,
        refer to the Ansible Tower Installation and Reference Guide:

        Ansible Tower introduced Clustering as an alternate approach to redundancy,
        replacing the redundancy solution configured with the active-passive nodes
        that involves primary and secondary instances.

        Clustering is sharing load between hosts. Each instance should be able to act
        as an entry point for UI and API access. This should enable Ansible Tower
        administrators to use load balancers in front of as many instances of Ansible Tower
        as desired and maintain good data visibility.

        Details of this approach are documented in the "Clustering" section of the
        Ansible Tower Administration Guide:
