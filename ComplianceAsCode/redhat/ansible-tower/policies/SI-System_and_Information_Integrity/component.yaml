        'The customer will be responsible for handling and retaining
        information within, or hosted by, Ansible Tower in
        accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
        directives, policies, regulations, standards, and operational
        requirements. A successful control response will need to outline
        the specific requirements applicable to customer information
        handling and retention, and the means by which those requirements
        are met.

        Documentation and suggestions on protecting customer information
        hosted within the Ansible Tower environment
        is forthcoming. This activity
        is being tracked in GitHub:
