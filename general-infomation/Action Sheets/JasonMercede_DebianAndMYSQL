***DEBYIN***

--Change root password and login password for my user (passwd -l) (Check sudoers)
--Uninstall nc if it’s there because why should I have nc
--Do we really need Ruby? Maybe we should take that off as well, there’s lots of CVEs for that
--Check the following for sneaky script dudes like they did with Alpine Nano (.bashrc) (so I can disable them early on)
    Cat
    Nano
    Vim
    Passwd
    Sh
    Bash
    Ls
    Sudo
    Systemctl
    Init
    Chmod
    Who
    Iptables
    Ufw
    mysql_secure_installation
--Check /etc/passwd for any weird looking users and change anything that’s not me (or out of scope) to /sbin/nologin so they can’t get on my dang system
--Check the crontab for any stupid stuff, disable all of it and set it to a-w permissions so no one can ever change it again
--Set up a watcher script that watches for any new instances of sh or bash, have a separate window that just kills them as soon as they get in (Check ps -faux)
--Perhaps change the /etc/ssh/sshd.conf file so that only specific users (the ones I can use) can login with ssh to prevent anyone else from being mean
--Check systemd scripts for any backdoor crap, list them all with systemctl --type=service and see if any suspicious stuff is running
--Edit /etc/security/limits.conf to limit 1 login per user
--IF YOU CAN TAKE UPDATES, DIRTY COW IS NASTY AND CAUSES RASHES


***MYSQL***

--Run sudo mysql_secure_installation to make all the stuff secure
--Know what interface is to be used with MySQL, is that the phpmyadmin thing or are you going cmd only?
--Remove all weird users from the mysqld users group in my.cnf file (in /etc i think) so that only YOU can prevent forest fires (this includes root)
--Rerun mysql with --skip-symbolic-links option so nobody can make symlinks to tables
--What permissions does mysql user have? Consider if they had mysql cli access
